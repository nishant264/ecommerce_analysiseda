# E-commerce Data Cleaning & Exploratory Data Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on cleaning, analyzing, and extracting insights from an e-commerce sales dataset.  
The goal is to simulate a real-world analytics task where raw business data is transformed into meaningful insights.

## 🧹 Data Cleaning Steps
- Handled missing values in product prices using median imputation
- Removed duplicate records to ensure data integrity
- Converted date columns into proper datetime format
- Created a new feature `Total_Revenue` for analysis

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis
- Analyzed revenue distribution across different cities
- Studied monthly sales trends to identify seasonality
- Visualized insights using Matplotlib and Seaborn

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
